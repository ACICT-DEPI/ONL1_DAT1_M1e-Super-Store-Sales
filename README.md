# Super-Store-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
## Project Overview

![](images/intro.png)

Superstore is a fictional retail company based in the United States. They specialize in selling furniture, office supplies, and technology products.This project focuses on analyzing sales performance, customer segmentation, profitability, shipping performance, and forecasting using a superstore's dataset. Additionally, data modeling, validation, governance, and outlier analysis were conducted to ensure accurate results and insights.

## Objectives
- Data Understanding: Analyze and understand the dataset structure, including key variables and relationships.
  
- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure the data is accurate for analysis.
  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to gain initial insights and spot trends.
  
- Data Visualization: Create dashboards and visual representations to communicate findings.
  
- Insights & Recommendations: Based on the analysis, provide actionable insights and recommendations.

- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each order (Qualitative).
  
- **Order Date**: Date when the order was placed (Qualitative).
  
- **Ship Date**: Date when the order was shipped (Qualitative).
  
- **Ship Mode**: Shipping method (e.g., Standard Class, First Class) (Qualitative).
  
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer (Qualitative).
  
- **Customer Name**: Name of the customer (Qualitative).
  
- **Segment**: Customer segment (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, Home Office) (Qualitative).
  
- **Country**: Country of the customer (Qualitative).
  
- **City**: City where the order was placed (Qualitative).
  
- **State**: State where the order was placed (Qualitative).
  
- **Postal Code**: Customerâ€™s postal code (Qualitative).
  
- **Region**: Region of the customer (e.g., West, East, Central, South) (Qualitative).
  
- **Product ID**: Unique identifier for each product (Qualitative).
  
- **Category**: Product category (e.g., Furniture, Office Supplies) (Qualitative).
  
- **Sub-Category**: Product sub-category (e.g., Chairs, Binders) (Qualitative).
  
- **Product Name**: Name of the product (Qualitative).
  
- **Sales**: Total sales amount in monetary value (Quantitative).
  
- **Quantity**: Number of units ordered (Quantitative).
  
- **Discount**: Discount applied to the order (Quantitative).
  
- **Profit**: Profit earned from the sale (Quantitative).
  
### Data Types:
#### Quantitative Variables:
Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit: Numeric fields that measure performance metrics.
#### Qualitative Variables:
Customer Name, City, Segment, Product Name, etc.: Categorical fields that define different aspects of the orders and customers.
Data Characteristics:
Quantitative Data: The numeric data (Sales, Quantity, Discount, and Profit) is crucial for understanding profitability, discount impact, and product sales.
Qualitative Data: The categorical data (Segment, Product Category, Region, etc.) helps analyze customer preferences, geographic trends, and product segmentation.
### Data Scope:
This dataset provides a comprehensive view of sales and performance across regions, customer segments, and product lines, making it well-suited for analyzing sales performance, customer segmentation, shipping and delivery, and profitability.
